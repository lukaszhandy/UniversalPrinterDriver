# UniwersalPrinterDriver
If you have a problem with your HP 2014 device and the UPD shows in the device manager: "this device cannot start. (Code 10)" this script can help you.
The script needs to be run each time the computer is started and that the printer be turned on before the computer.
Have fun.
